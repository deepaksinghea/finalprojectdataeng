# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning 

Academic Final Project @ Data Engineering Class

Using Scikit-Learn & StreamLit, I have built a web app for making heart disease predictions using different algorithms and metrics to analyze. Metrics include Accuracy Score, F1 score, classification report, ROC Curve and Confusion Matrix.

Algorithms used are KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression & Random Forest with hyper parameter tuning.

# Business Understanding / Executive Summary
Heart Disease is one of leading causes of death in the United States, high blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and smoking are the key factors contributing to the disease. About half of the population in the country has one of the above risk factors. Healthcare is expensive in United States which makes it difficult for patients to get the disease diagnosed at proper time to take preventive measures. It will be helpful if we build automated systems capable of making prediction about possible heart disease using patientsâ€™ historical data. With the help of machine learning, we can accomplish the same and obtain accurate and reliable results as you will see in the project.

# Highlights of Project

The idea of the project is to provide end-users to try out different models with hyper parameter tuning to make accurate predictions on heart disease classification dataset. We have deployed numerous metrics to evaluate the model such as accuracy and F1 score, area under the curve, confusion matrix and correlation heatmap to understand the results clearly and concisely. The web application was tested locally and deployed on the web using tools such as Stream Lit and Git for seamless integration from development to production setting.
